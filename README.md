# Project Overview

This is a Django-based web application for managing production and quality control in a manufacturing environment. The system tracks inventory, handles sales and production orders, and supports analytics.

---

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- OS: Windows 10+ or macOS 11+
- SQLite (default, no need to install separately)

---

# Setup Instructions (Source Code)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ehab-work/quality-control
cd quality-control
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

#### Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Migrations

```bash
pip install Pillow
pip install opencv-python
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create Superuser (optional)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 6. Run Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open in browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

---

## Configuration Details

- **Database**: SQLite (configured by default in `settings.py`)
- **Authentication**: JWT via `rest_framework_simplejwt`
- **CORS**: Enabled for all origins and localhost:3000 (for frontend)

---

## Troubleshooting

- If `ModuleNotFoundError` → activate virtualenv and ensure `pip install -r requirements.txt` succeeded.
- If `port 8000 already in use` → run `python manage.py runserver 8001`
- For frontend connection, ensure CORS is allowed from the frontend domain (localhost:3000).



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `cd quality-control/frontendV3`
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
